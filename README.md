Abstract

With the rapid growth of digital streaming platforms, users often face difficulty selecting movies from vast collections. This project proposes a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies based on similarities in genres, cast, crew, keywords, and taglines.

The system integrates:

- Bag of Words Model
- Jaccard Similarity
- K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
- K-Means Clustering (PySpark)
- Apache Hive for data analysis
- Power BI for visualization

The system is designed to handle large datasets efficiently using Big Data technologies and machine learning techniques.

Objectives

- To develop a content-based movie recommendation system
- To extract meaningful features from movie data
- To handle large datasets using Big Data tools
- To analyze and visualize movie data effectively
- To generate personalized movie recommendations

Dataset Used

TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset (Kaggle)

The dataset includes:

- Movie titles
- Genres
- Cast
- Crew (Directors)
- Keywords
- Taglines
- Budget
- Revenue
- Popularity
- Ratings

Methodology

The system follows these major steps:

1. Data Collection  
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
3. Feature Extraction using Bag of Words  
4. Similarity Measurement using Jaccard Similarity  
5. Recommendation using K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)  
6. Clustering using K-Means (PySpark)  
7. Data Analysis using Hive Query Language  
8. Visualization using Power BI
